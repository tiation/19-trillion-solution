*A Tiation & ChaseWhiteRabbit Initiative*

## üåü About the Solution

This project, developed by **Tiation** in partnership with **ChaseWhiteRabbit**, presents a comprehensive economic reform proposal for Australia. It demonstrates how the nation's existing assets can be leveraged to create systemic change that removes barriers and empowers communities.

### Key Outcomes

- **Eliminate public debt** across all levels of government
- **Pre-fund government operations** for 5+ years  
- **Provide Universal Basic Income** backed by real assets
- **Create sustainable economic growth** through asset-backed monetary policy
- **Transform grief into hope** through evidence-based policy reform

### Our Mission

Aligned with ChaseWhiteRabbit's core belief that **automation is compassion at scale**, this solution demonstrates how technology and cooperative economics can address root causes of social problems rather than just symptoms.
