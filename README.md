# The $19 Trillion Solution

Australia's balance sheet says we're a $19 trillion nation. If we unlock even a third of that value, we can wipe every public debt, pre-pay government for five years, and put an asset-plus-UBI in every adult and child's pocket—today.

## 🌟 About the Solution

This project presents a comprehensive economic reform proposal for Australia, demonstrating how the nation's existing assets can be leveraged to:

- **Eliminate public debt** across all levels of government
- **Pre-fund government operations** for 5+ years
- **Provide Universal Basic Income** backed by real assets
- **Create sustainable economic growth** through asset-backed monetary policy
