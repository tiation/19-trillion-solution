**60-Second Deep Dive**
```
"The Australian Bureau of Statistics has a secret. 
Our national balance sheet shows $19 trillion in wealth.
Divided equally, that's $104,000 for every Australian.
But we debate education funding like money doesn't exist.
The solution? Digital Civic Shares - your portion of national wealth
delivered as $800 weekly, backed by real assets.
No debt. No inflation. Just sharing what we already own.
A child born tomorrow will never know poverty.
The wealth exists. The mechanism is proven.
We just need the courage to share."
